# QuizApp

This is a project I made for Advanced programming course (2nd year of faculty).
It relies massively on GUI (Swing), Collections and Serialization.
It provides the tools necessary to make a quiz and save it as a serialized object with .quizapp extension.
Also it provides the interface to solve the .quizapp test.
It's a project done in hurry (2-3 weeks), not state of the art software,but kindda proves my abilities to code in Java.

I apologize for the lack of comments; at that time I didn't thought someone else will read my code, beside my professor.
